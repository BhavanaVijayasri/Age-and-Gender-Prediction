Features

Deep Learning Model

The CNN model includes multiple convolutional and pooling layers to effectively capture facial features critical for age and gender prediction.

Gender Prediction: Provides binary classification for gender (Male/Female).

Age Estimation: Either regression for age estimation or classification into predefined age ranges.

Data-Driven Insights: Extracts meaningful demographic insights from images, which can be useful in sectors like retail, advertising, and user experience design.

Usage

Prepare the Data: Download the dataset and place it in the Data directory. Ensure that images are labeled correctly for age and gender categories.

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open main_Age_and_Gender_Prediction_CNN.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Follow the notebook instructions to load the data, preprocess it, train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance on test data.

Making Predictions:

After training, you can use the trained model to predict age and gender for new facial images.

Simply provide the path to a new image, and the notebook will display the age and gender prediction results.

Model Architecture

The CNN model used for this project has a layered architecture with:

Convolutional Layers: For feature extraction, detecting patterns such as edges, textures, and facial contours.

Pooling Layers: Reducing spatial dimensions to retain essential features while reducing computational complexity.

Fully Connected Layers: Performing high-level reasoning based on the features learned by the convolutional layers.

Output Layer:

Gender Output: Uses a binary classifier to predict Male or Female.

Age Output: Regression for age estimation or classification into age groups.

Data Preprocessing

Image Resizing: All images are resized to a standard input size to ensure consistency across the dataset.

Normalization: Pixel values are normalized to improve model convergence during training.

Data Augmentation (optional): Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling can be applied to increase dataset variety and prevent overfitting.

Training Process

Loss Function:

Binary Cross-Entropy for gender classification.

Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Categorical Cross-Entropy for age estimation based on the prediction type (regression or classification).

Optimizer: Adam optimizer is used for its efficiency and adaptive learning rate capabilities.

Metrics: Accuracy for gender prediction and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or accuracy for age prediction.

Results

The model has shown promising results:

Gender Classification: Achieved high accuracy across diverse demographic groups.

Age Prediction: Reasonable accuracy for age groups, although specific performance may vary depending on dataset quality.

Example predictions are included in the notebook to showcase the model's performance on test data.
